    <h2>The Vision</h2>
<br>
    <p1>DreamScape is an exciting environmentally responsible project that brings together the best in entertainment,
      fun and hospitality - a year round, world class family-themed facility.

      Focused on our environment and climate issues DreamScape One is a vision of the way forward for society based on
      renewable energy sources, sustainability and a carbonless footprint. At a footprint of 500 acres for the enclosed
      environment with a minimum ceiling height of 160 feet, DreamScape (short form) is building the mega structures of
      the future.</p1> <br>
<br>
    <p2>The DreamScape business model is based on everything under one roof, protected from the outside elements
      year-round. The concept is unique just on its sheer size and the aspects of its self-sustainability before adding
      in our advance marketing campaign and futuristic technology. For all intents and purposes DS1 (acronym) is being
      designed as a Theme Park complimented with the right balance of added features, which will help to offset the high
      cost of building such a structure.</p2> <br> <br>

    <p3>Theme Parks have an established record of longevity and profiting in any economy, especially being year-round.
      DreamScape is about people; we can accommodate a large amount of residency in addition to a tremendous volume of
      vacationers/tourists making this a global destination. The time has come in our evolution cycle to provide
      enhanced, safe communities that confronts our environment and climate change issues with a positive impact.</p3>
